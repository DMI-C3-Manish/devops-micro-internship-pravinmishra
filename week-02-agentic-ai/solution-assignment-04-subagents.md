# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

The cost optimizer uses Haiku because it only needs to perform simple, lightweight tasks like checking Terraform resources and finding cost-saving opportunities. Haiku is faster and more cost-effective, while Sonnet is better suited for complex reasoning tasks such as security analysis.

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

The security auditor does not have Write permission because its role is only to review and analyze Terraform configurations. Removing write access prevents accidental changes and follows the principle of least privilege, ensuring it can only perform the tasks it needs.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

The tf-writer uses inherit so it can use the default model configured in Claude Code. This provides flexibility for code generation and modification tasks instead of restricting it to a specific model.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

### Evidence

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — The full cost optimization report
